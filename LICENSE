TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

"The Program" refers to the copyrightable work licensed under this License.

"You" refers to each licensee (an individual or entity exercising rights
under this License).

"Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the source
code needed to generate, install, and (for an interactive program) run the
object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those
activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or
general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used
unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work.

"Network Server" means a program that provides services (e.g., a web service)
and allows communication with other programs (e.g., clients).

"Copyleft Section" means the requirement that any software derived from the
Program must also be released under the same or compatible license.

1. Source Code.

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.

2. Basic Permissions.

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright
on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.
You are granted the royalty-free, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
right to exercise all the rights given by this License.

3. Copyleft Requirement.

If you modify the Program, your modified version must also be free software
under copyleft. Any derivative work must:

(a) Carry prominent notices stating that you modified the files;
(b) License the entire work under the same license (AGPL-3.0);
(c) Include a copy of this license with your work;
(d) If the work is a network service, offer users access to the source code.

4. Network Services.

If you run a modified version of the Program as a network service
(e.g., hosting it on a server), you must provide a mechanism for users to
download the complete source code of your modified version, even if they
do not typically connect to interactive features.

Failure to provide source code to network service users is a material
breach of this License.

5. Conveying Modified Versions.

You may convey a modified version of the Program under the terms of this
License provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

(a) The work must carry prominent notices stating the dates of any changes
    and that it is modified version;
(b) The work must carry prominent notices stating it is released under
    this License;
(c) You must license the entire work under the same terms as this License;
(d) You must provide recipients with the source code;
(e) If modified to run on network servers, provide the identical mechanism
    for network users to download the source code.

6. Patents.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
license under claims in their contribution that would be infringed by your
use of the Program.

7. Additional Terms.

If you combine the Program with other works, you may choose to place the
combined work under terms of your choice, provided that you also comply
with this License for each part that is covered by this License.

8. No Warranty.

THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR
OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE,
ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROGRAM.

9. Limitation of Liability.

IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING
ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF
THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM.
